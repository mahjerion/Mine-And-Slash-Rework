## What are levels?

Levels, or somewhere stated Combat Levels (to differ from Profession levels), are your main progression mechanic.
Every time you gain a level up, you will get some amount of talent, stat, spell or passive points.

## How do I level up?

Killing hostile mobs!

## How Do I use my points?

There are a few different points you get:

1) Stat Points: Open the Main Hub [H], choose between STR, INT or DEX

<ModAsset width="50%" location="mmorpg:stat_points" />

2) Talent Points: Main Hub > Talents. Pick a starting point and you're on your own!

<ModAsset width="50%" location="mmorpg:talent_screen" />

3) Spell Points: Main Hub > Classes. You should learn a damaging spell right away!

4) Passive Points: Main Hub > Classes. These are small passive boosts available only to specific classes

<ModAsset width="50%" location="mmorpg:spells" />

5) Ascendancy Points: Main Hub > Ascendancies. These are major build-defining points.
You won't get them every level!
